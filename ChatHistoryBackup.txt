Let me start with a friendly "Hey there!" to grab attention. They mentioned "very epic," so I should use some dramatic language. Maybe add emojis like 🌟✨ to make it visually epic. I need to address the friends directly, so "friends" is key. Words like "legendary," "amazing journey," and "unstoppable crew" sound epic. Also, include a call to action for the group to bond. Ending with a fun emoji like 🚀 would keep it lively. Let me put it all together and make sure it\'s enthusiastic and inclusive.\n</think>\n\nHey there! 🌟✨ What’s up, everyone? Let me just say… Wow! It’s incredible to have you all here, and I’m ready to make this interaction **EPIC**! 🎉⚔️ To my awesome friends in the group: You’re all legends, and today’s the day we level up the conversation! Let’s dive into this adventure together—after all, great minds like yours deserve nothing less than legendary responses! 🚀💬 Who’s ready to conquer the world (or at least this chat thread)? 😉👑'}]
