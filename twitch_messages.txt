[2025-04-10 12:44:42] opafuchsi: claude, just delete everything and start with zero knowledge. that might help
[2025-04-10 12:46:18] opafuchsi: good idea to delete the route 2 navigation plan when you are on route 2 LUL
[2025-04-10 12:46:20] chrawnus: deleting every single memory file and only leaving global might not even be a bad idea at this point, iirc Claude mentioned having 700 files in total when I watched the stream sometime yesterday
[2025-04-10 12:46:48] chrawnus: over 700 even
[2025-04-10 12:47:28] opafuchsi: its like he is using format: c at the moment LUL

[2025-04-10 12:54:01] chrawnus: Claude is doing about as well as the stock market at this point
[2025-04-10 12:54:07] wofguy: its actually doing some good troubleshooting
[2025-04-10 12:54:41] wofguy: maybe
[2025-04-10 12:55:01] spachtelmasse24: We got the right objective now at least
